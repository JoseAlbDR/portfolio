# Personal Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal landing page, which serves as a way to introduce myself, showcase my work, projects, and education. Currently, I am a full-stack web development student.

## Technologies Used 🚀

The project is primarily developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The final version of the project utilizes Parcel as the package manager.

## Installation ⚙️

You can view the final web page in the `dist` directory. If you prefer not to use the `dist` directory, you need to use Parcel and the scripts found in the `package.json` file.

## Usage 🖥️

This is a landing page without complex functionalities, but it includes animations. You can scroll or use the navigation menu to move through the page. You will also find links to my social media profiles, contact information, and projects.

## Features ✨

- Use of JavaScript to dynamically display the content of some HTML sections, following an MVC architecture.
- Implementation of visual effects using CSS.
